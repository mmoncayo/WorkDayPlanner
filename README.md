# WorkDayScheduler

This day planner was created to form a typical work scheduler from the business hours of 9am-5pm. Each hour is given its own row with the option to write in the activity/assignment to complete and the user must click the save icon in order for the entry to save. 

Upon refreshing the page, the entry should still persist so long as the save button was clicked. Furthermore each row is color coded based on the time of day the user is looking at the browser. 

* If the hour is of the past, then it will be displayed in gray
* If the hour is the present hour, then it will be displayed in red
* If the hour is in the future, then it will be displayed in green

The current day is displayed at the header of the main page at the top to reference what day it is.
